File submission for CGAP
------------------------


.. Note::

 Badges go here. Later.


Description
===========

This is a tool for uploading files to CGAP.


System Requirements
===================

* Python 3.6
* Pip (Any should work)
* Virtualenv (>=15.0.0)

Setting Up a Virtual Environment (OPTIONAL)
===========================================

This is optional.
If you do not create a virtual environment, Poetry will make one for you.
But there are still good reasons you might want to make your own, so here
are three ways to do it:

* If you have virtualenvwrapper that knows to use Python 3.6::

   mkvirtualenv myenv

* If you have virtualenv but not virtualenvwrapper, and you have python3.6 in your ``PATH``::

   virtualenv myenv -p python3.6

* If you are using ``pyenv`` to control what environment you use::

   pyenv exec python -m venv myenv


Installing Poetry in a Virtual Environment
==========================================

Once you have created a virtual environment, or have decided to just let Poetry handle that,
install with poetry::

   poetry install


Getting Started
===============

TBD.
